Deduper pseudocode:

Problem: Amplification during library prep leads to PCR duplicates. This may cause issues in downstream analysis. Our goal is to remove them. Ideally only the best copy should be kept.



Startup:
•	Shebang line: #!/usr/bin/env python 3.9
•	Import my usual stuff: Bioinfo.py, argparse, matplotlib, gzip if needed.
•	Import SAM file and UMI file with argparse


Write Function 1: 
Clip_check
	This function checks if a read has been clipped. Input is (CIGAR)
	If this has been clipped it will return read_has_been_clipped = True
If this has not been clipped it will return read_has_been_clipped = False
This will also check if the read was clipped at the start or end. Location = Start, End, NA
Example: Input: 54M1266N17M
	Output: read_has_been_clipped = False, Location = NA

Write Function 2:
	Clipped_start_position_finder
	This function will calculate the start position of a read based on its cigar string.
	Insertion = ignore, deletion = add, softclip-start = subtract, softclip-end = add
	NOTE: I am unsure of the line above. Please lmk if i am wrong. <3
	In: CIGAR, position, Location
	Out: True Position
Example: Input(CIGAR=2S40M1I30M and position=100 and Location = Start)
	Perform: 100 – 2 = 98
	Output: position = 98

Write Function 3:
	Best_Duplicate
	This function will compare two duplicates and take the most complete duplicate to keep. This is based off which one is not soft-clipped / has fewest INDELS /fewest N’s in sequence
	In: Two sequences
	Out: The better sequence
Example: Input:Sequence 1: 71M
	       Sequence 2: 70M2I
	Output: Sequence 1


Then start code code:

Read UMIs into a dictionary
Create dictionary “PCR_deduped”

For loop:
•For each line in SAM file:
	Separate line into list using .split
	Toss if Qname doesn’t include correct UMI
		Then go back to top of loop
	Run Clip_check
	If read_has_been_clipped == TRUE
		Run Clipped_start_postion_finder
	Check identifiers: Rname, position, strand
	If these have a matching value in PCR_deduped:
		Run Best_Duplicate
	If these don’t have a matching value: add to PCR_deduped
•Write out to file


I think this is everything…
